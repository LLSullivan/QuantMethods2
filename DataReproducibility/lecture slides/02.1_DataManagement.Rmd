## Why Manage Data?

- Allows you to **quality control** your data more easily.
- Helps you stay **organized** through the whole process of file management, script creation, version control, backups, etc.
- Enables **reproducibility**.  You always want to be able to recreate figures and analyses from the data that produced them.  Even 3 years later.
- Helps you **share** your data more easily for future meta-analyses, etc.  This allows for larger understanding of your field.



## Organization is Key to Data \& Project Management

For each R project/manuscript, you will want to have a set of folders. Here is a suggestion, but there are many options.

\bigskip

  - Data
  - Data Wrangling
  - Analysis
  - Graphics
  - Documents
  - ReadMe


## Folder Structure in Detail
\scriptsize
  - Data
    - raw data (read-only, pristine backup, not to be touched)
    - tidy data (intermediate and final R datasets)
  - Data Wrangling
    - DataAcquisition.R - script for compiling all data files into a single, usable dataset.
  - Analysis
  - Graphics
  - Documents
    - Manuscript folder
    - Literature folder
  - ReadMe
    - metadata
    - write down the driving questions and purposes of the project and other notes.

  
\textit{\textcolor{purple}{\scriptsize{Note: Your code will stay cleaner if you use many smaller scripts, e.g. one for all analyses, one for all figures \textbf{OR} one for each analysis and the associated figures}}}



## Tips for Entering Raw Data for R Analysis



- No spaces in column headers
- Note units either in column header or in associated metadata
- R is case sensitive so keep column headers in a case structure  (e.g. snake_case, dot.case)
- The difference between “0” and “NA” and a blank cell all tells you something
- Fill all columns



```{r, out.width='75%', fig.align='center', fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics('../images/data_entry.png')
```


## Relational Data

When thinking about how to enter your data...

  - Store data as smaller units (hierarchical and by type) and link through code. 
  - For example: store site level data in one file, and plot level data in another. Then link these datasets through code.
    - This helps avoid confusion and repetition
    - Great for large, interconnected datasets, especially those that can change
    - Data management systems play well with data in this format (e.g. Tidy, SQL)
    - Can be linked as 1:1, many to one (n:1), or one to many (1:n)



## An Extreme Example of Relational Data


```{r, out.width='105%', fig.align='center', fig.cap=' From Lind (2016) Ecological Informatics'}
knitr::include_graphics('../images/SQL.png')
```

## Git and GitHub
 
 GitHub is a great resource for managing data and code. If you are interested, there are lots of great resources out there.  Here are a few.
