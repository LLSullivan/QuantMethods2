We will be examining data from: MacArthur 1956. [Population ecology of some warblers of Northeastern coniferous forests](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/1931600). \textit{Ecology}. This is a foundational paper in Ecology, as it was part of the inital work on how to define a species' niche width and breadth.


MacArthur was trying to understand a set of 5 species of warblers in Maine. People believed that these species were an "exception" to the concept of the niche, which at the time stated that species needed to differ in their resource use in order to coexist.  These species were seen as an exception because they all seemed nearly identical in where they lived and what they ate.  However in his paper, MacArthur determined that these species utilized different parts of trees for foraging, and that they ate different resources at different times and thus were able to coexist.  


In this homework, we will focus on the observations he made of the different warbler species in different areas of trees. MacArthur studied 16 sites within trees, which are labeled in Figure 1. There are 6 heights (1-6) on the tree, which I flipped so the tallest height is 6 and the shortest height is 1. There are also three "zones" including bare zones at the base of the trunk (B) that are often covered in lichen, middle zones (M) with old needles, and terminal zones (T) with new needles or buds. We will be using the data on the right side of these tree figures that indicates the number of observations of each of the 5 studied warblers within each of the 16 sites (I have converted the data into # of observations, not % of total observations).Our goal will be to figure out what we can learn from this data using multivariate statistics - which was not a method used frequently in the 50's.

```


**Q1** Let's start by examining the data. Look at the data and explain how the dataset is structured. What are the rows? What are the columns?  Pay special attention to the species data.  How is it organized?

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```

**Q2** Let's visualize the data. Create barplots for each of the warblers in each zone and see if you can visually see a difference betwen the birds and where they spend most of their time. Does it look like the birds use different habitats?


```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}


```

## Distance Matrices

**Q3** To understand how different these 16 sites are within the tree, we need to create distance matrices to represent the dissimilarity between each site.  The first step to this is standardizing the data. Create three standardized data matrices using `decostand()`, standardizing for site total, site max, and presence/absence.  Compare these outcomes.


```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}


```

**Q4** Now let's create a distances matrix for our data.  It does not make sense to use either Euclidean or Manhattan distance because these points do not have a physical distance between the two.  So similar to other community abundance datasets, let's try creating a Bray-Curtis distance matrix, as well as a Jaccard distance matrix to really upweight rare events. Make sure to use the datset that is standardized by site totals for the Bray-Curtis distance matrix, and the dataset that is standardized by presence/absense for the Jaccard distance matrix.


```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}



```


**Q5** Using both of your distance matrices, what is the distance between sites 1 and 7, sites 3 and 4, sites 13 and 16? Explain what you see between the two distance measures for those between sites 1 and 7.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```


**Q6** Using the standardized data by site totals and the `metaMDS()` function with Bray-Curtis distance, create three metaMDS objects, with dimensions `k=1`, `k=2`, and `k=3`. Create the plot that looks at stress for those three dimensions, and describe the patterns and stress you see for each metaMDS object. What is the approximate stress for each dimension? Based on these results, which dimension would you choose and why?

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```

**Q7**  There's also a nice function in the `goeveg` library called `dimchecksMDS()` that helps you explore the number of dimensions vs the stress.  Check out this function, create the dimension v stress plot and see how your results compare to above.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```


## NMDS

**Q8** Create a plot that shows the metaMDS results from `k=2`. Make sure to label the plots and birds. What does this plot tell you? Are there some birds that appear to inhabit more similar plots and some that appear to inhabit different plots?  If so, which ones?

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```


**Q9** Create the same plot as for 7, but with a jaccard distance matrix (same dimenion level, using the presence/absence standardized data).  Describe the difference between this plot and that from Question 7. How does a different standardization and distance method affect the nMDS visualization outcome?

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}


```

## Environmental Fit

**Q10** Going back to the visualization from Question 7, where we used Bray-Curtis distance and `k=2`. Create an environmental fit (using `envfit()`) for the last 2 columns in the original dataset that describe the zone and height that the birds inhabit.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```

**Q11** Create a triplot for this environmental fit.  Describe the figure and the direction of the two environmental variables.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```

**Q12** Create a triplot that shows the surface for the Cape May warbler, and describe the figure.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}


```

**Q13** Create a triplot that shows the convex hulls for each zone and describe the figure.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}


```


**Q14** For practice, also create a triplot that shows the spider diagrams for each zone and each height in separate figures.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```
