## Multivariate Analysis


There are several ways to look at multivariate patterns from a matrix of **Y**'s.

1.  Linear models: MANOVA/regression to test patterns

2.  **Ordination: PCA, nMDS, etc to visualize patterns**

3.  Permutation tests: PERMANOVA to test patterns



## Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA)

PCA works well for data where it's appropriate to maintain Euclidean distance among objects.

- However, what do you do when have data that requires a different distance matrix, or where PCA is not a good model (e.g.: many 0's, presence/absence data)?

\bigskip

Principle coordinate analysis decomposes distance matrices (or dissimilarity matrices) such that distance among objects is preserved for **any** distance measure.

- Sometimes PCoA is called metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) because it preserves relationships among objects.
- This is opposed to nMDS that does not preserve distance, but attempts to preserve *relationships* among objects.


## Understanding PCoA

**Step 1:** Start with a distance matrix (**D**).

**Step 2:** Transform elements in **D** to:  $\bf{A} = -\frac{1}{2}\bf{D}^2$

**Step 3:** Double-center the matrix.

  - Subtract row and column means from each element, and add grand mean. This positions the origin at the centroid of the scatter.


**Step 4:** Eigen-decomposition of double-centered matrix.

  - Eigen vectors are *coordinates* for the ordination plot. They do not describe aspects of the Y variables, only distances among objects/sites/samples (similar to nMDS).



## Sparrow Data

Let's look at this sparrow data again.

```{r, out.width='90%', fig.align='center', fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics('../images/sparrow.jpg')
```


## PCoA

Let's look again at our **Y** from the sparrow data but with a Manhattan distance matrix ("city block" distance).
  
- Use the `pcoa()` [\textcolor{teal}{function}](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ape/versions/5.3/topics/pcoa) in the `ape` library.

\bigskip
\scriptsize
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=6}
sparrow.d <- vegdist(sparrow[, -c(1:3)], "manhattan")
sparrow.pcoa <- pcoa(sparrow.d)
sparrow.pcoa$values[1:10,1:5]
```

## Plotting


\scriptsize
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=6}
biplot(sparrow.pcoa, plot.axes = c(1,2))
```

*Note:* Apparently you can plot the data on these ordination plots similar to nMDS with an env.fit, but I couldn't quite figure out how to get it to work.
