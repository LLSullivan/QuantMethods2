Modules from Quantitative Methods in the Life Sciences 2 at University of Missouri - 2022

Here I have uploaded all of the required materials for 3 modules in the Advanced Quantitative Methods in the Life Sciences course that I taught at University of Missouri.  There are three modules:  1) Data Reproducibility, 2) Generalized Linear Models, and 3) Multivariate Models.  Within each module you will see folders that contain the following listed below.


> Data

- here you can find all data for the lecture slides and problem sets.  If you keep the data in this file structure, and set your working directory to be the same as the "source file location" for your lecture slides and problem sets, everything should run.


> Images 

- here you can find all images for the lecture slides and problem sets.  If you keep the images in this file structure, and set your working directory to be the same as the "source file location" for your lecture slides and problem sets, everything should run.


> Lecture Slides

- Here are the .RMD and .pdf files for the lectures.


> Problem Sets

- You have to have the style.css file in the same working directory as the problem set file to get it to knit correctly.
